# Rain Prediction Model

### Introduction

The Rain Prediction Model is a machine learning project developed to predict whether it will rain tomorrow based on various weather features. The model utilizes logistic regression and is trained on historical weather data. This serves as a guide to set up and use the model.

### Installation
After cloning the repository, install required dependencies on your machine.

### Usage
Once installed, you can use the Rain Prediction Model as follows:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook Rain_Prediction_Model.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute each cell and train the model, make predictions, and evaluate its performance.

### Model Description

The Rain Prediction Model employs logistic regression and utilizes various weather features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc., to predict whether it will rain tomorrow. It preprocesses the data, including handling missing values, scaling numeric features, and encoding categorical features, before training the model.
